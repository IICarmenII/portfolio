I was sent on my way by my patron, got introduced to masq by … we made our way to the dreamlanders. We’ve been with the dreamlanders for like 2 week. 

After we did a few chores for the dreamlanders we got sent into town to distribute flyers. We split up. The group that I was in (Puppi , Abraxas, Alin , and Calumn) met a nice lady named Theruoa, distributed some flyers in the tavern as well ( met a nice elven woman there and a couple who we played for). The other group (masq and hallbjorn) went to the lodge, got 2 quests that we know of and paid a bit of money for a cooler quest that we can also take but the party only knows of one (the pest one). After that we met up in the tavern. There we discussed a bit about what happened to our perspective groups. Just as we were about to head out again (Calumn was bringing the glasses to the counter) there was a boar that went through the western gate into town. And that’s where we left off. 

We fought the boar using little magic (didn’t get noticed) while fighting the “boar” (he was kind of a monstrosity or some crazy shit like that) the 2 guards that ran away from the boar both got killed during the fight. There were 2 more guards that came in with Evryiel (lied) she’s supposed to take care of the safety of this town, she's kinda against the druids. We got some cool fur from the boar that can be turned into a cloak with leather workers tools, the cloak remains dry, and auto saves on saving thrones against the effects of extreme cold. We met a man in the alchemist shop named meek, he has a wife. Meek sells: alchemical charcoal, lunsk coal, artisans coal, void coal, normal charcoal. On his counter we found this poster of a wanted man 25gp reward for giving him to the torta (local militia).  We bought some things from him and he pointed us the way to druids who can do leather working. Halbjorn and Masq (Percilla) went off to the smith and found out more about the rat quest. 
Meaning the rest (Puppi , Calumn, Alin and abarax) we went to the druid circle. We heard Evryiel berating a man at the druid circle, the guy was being disrespectful to Evryiel he said the leather workers were currently indisposed, he gave me a look of disdain, said I could come back for leather workers when they get here later. In a day, day and a half. Alin complimented the tree and after that we headed out. Evryiel continued to berate the man. We left off going to the blacksmiths place, planning on making the hole bigger. 

When we went further into the cellar of the blacksmith (the ancient anvil) we found tendrils with white pebbles stuck inside the bark. Eventually we found a deadman in the bark (the blacksmith's neighbour) as well with his face sticking out. Some spider monsters came to hurt us (8? Babies 1 big momma) in the end we defeated the spider monsters but percilla got hurt so bad she was unconscious. We looted the spider things(8 0.1 slot darts, 6 0.5 daggers and one armour that can be crafted in the smithy for medium armour/heavy armour) and found some jewellery (30gp worth) we also got our lodge reward (10gp, free drink in the bar 50sp). We told the blacksmith militia and lodge what happened and gave the corpse of the man (we had broken him out of the bark) to the militia. After that we went back to the camp. On our way we saw some druidic ritual, Alin said it’s to praise the land, we saw that sus wanted poster blondie there as well but we don’t know this in character. 
In our RP: we headed back making sure to get Masq healed up by Tessilia, told the rest of the troup about the boar and that there are dangers in the woods. We bonded kinda with some drink but Calumn was pushed too far (to drink) and went off. The rest of the party finished their drinks and played a card game together. Afterwards Alin came to Calumn with a bone to make peace, they played a song together growing a bit closer. 

We started off last session having a nice breakfast with the group. Mazati said it’s alright if we lead today’s performance. After dinner Mazati and Tarvik went to get some drinks together, water was further away. After breakfast we went into town for some errandsF. On our way to town we saw the ritual place of the druids again, we saw a tree trunks woven together, vibrant green leaves with great ground nearby. With his witch sight Alin feels like the tree sucks magic around it into itself almost) it saps magic. Masq knew to call this tree a weirwood tree. When we got to the village some of us went to the druids, an ergonomic backpack is 65 gp. Alin asked what the druids think of the attack and why it happened, the druid said that this happens when mother nature is pushed. They brought this upon themselves. 
Hallbjorn ordered a 7sp gold for percilla/masq providing the coat himself with our boar fight. After that we went to the guard captain. She said that she thinks the town want to workshop: the lady, eventually with the druids. After the military stopped scouting she said beasts started coming into town. After that hallbjorn ordered one splinarmor after 3 days (at the date of the 9th of Vorhexen) he can get it. I bought a blood red and blue crayon as well. The guards captain said the wanted person skipped town a bit ago, stealing, pulverising everything, and came in with a group in the inn after a year she started acting crazy. The druids were listening in on us while we talked to the guards captain with a weasel. After that we headed back home. While walking Alin got attacked by a piece of paper, The marvels of the revella. Also we leveled up! :D

We started off the session with our concert, the intro song was mine and Alin’s song (https://youtu.be/QBXHN1XEPVc ) the guards came to see our song! After that we started off the show with a song with everyone who plays music the hunt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RB4bJ3H5eg after that poke and me played le chez e mort https://youtu.be/pTpOIGg6qPQ  after that Abraxas and Masq played a song together  https://youtu.be/8rNd0CSOBy8  during his performance an elf came in with a man. The elf is called Delilah, she was with a man but when we asked her if he was bothering her (that's how he appeared to be) he said why not tell them how it is but she didn’t and he was set away. Later Abraxis went on a date with her (UwU) she dissociates a lot, got to know abraxas, she can do magic even more than us (less than mizati) and explained that the man who was here thinks he owns her. 
Meanwhile the rest hung out, played hitting a rock with a mallet (Hallbjorn won) 
We stopped the session just when Delilah was about to kiss abraxis. 

Abraxis and delilah kissed, after that abraxis went to introduce delilah to everyone. Delilah didn’t say much, mazati already knew her name. Abraxis asked if it was okay if Delilah roomed with him, Mazati made gentle fun of him letting Abraxis know that he didn’t need to ask. After that we played liars dice, abraxis won. Abraxis also set up a scam for Calumn (saying he could make more money for Calumn if Calumn just gives him some of the money but later when they’re in a gambling town). After that we all went to bed, masq taking care to see if delilah and abraxis are alright before going to bed. 

We played liar's dice together, Abraxis won! Delilah got to be his gf kinda, she went to sleep with him in their own private room (UwU). 

We went by the smith? He doesn’t seem to worship the druidic religion. After that we went to start our quest. We went to the woodworker but there was no one home (no one in the shop and in the accompanying home) except… Jom jr. Jom jr. was told to sit by the table and wait, his dad told him this. After Calumn befriended him he found out that there were some blood trails in the home. After that we figured out that the wife of the woodworker was killed in their bed and her body was taken out of town. We went after the tracks, we ended up seeing giant bif feed footprints at the end of the tracks like there was a struggle. On our way to following those footprints we went through a pumpkin patch where we fought a giant pumpkin monster. After we killed that monster (very cool fight btw) we got the loot, continued on and we found a cave. It’s a long big cave, with human sized cages in it, further down in the cave we found rotten human bodies. And that’s where we left off. 

Further down the cave there were giant bats, luckily they kept sleeping while we went further down the cave. There we discovered a giant blind troll and Jom jr’s mom! She was unconscious. We defeated the troll and took her away. Before leaving Calumn got some fungus from this weird big fungus cloud in the back of the cave, he needed to be washed down before making it out without being poisoned and stuff. (how is this fungus affecting the rest of the plot? Did the druids have something to do with this or are the druids against stuff like this? We found weird plants in the other cave too). 

Abraxis lost the carrying of the nymph contest and the asshole centaur caught her, we made clear that we’d attack if he wifed the girl and then he tried to wife the nymph and we attacked, there was a big chase scene where I gave 2 of my inspirations and the group gave one as well from the vote for this session but still the bitch ass centaur grabbed her each time she just wrestled away from him. 

Got spied on by the weasel again when we were talking about jom jr’s mom and him. We saw Mazati extorsionan a woman (we thought it could have been flirting). Looked into the druids but they were pretending to be okay luckily in a while with the help from the torta leader we found that sus blonde person. Sanriel and Evelyn were screaming at each other in the courthouse while Hallbjorn and Calumn were waiting for them. Constantine was introduced to the party. Constantine found a secret tunnel and someone was in danger. The rest of the party came to tell Hallbjorn and Calumn about this. With that long ass explanation is where we left off. 

After an explanation we went over to the druids.Hallbjorn told the militia that the head of the militia gave the order that they should constrict the druids. (OMG) after that we went into the SECRET TUNNEEELL. We came across cave mushrooms along the way, we also saw exposed roots of the trees going across town. We first had to climb over a wall, then had to get over a 10ft wide chasm, after that we climbed out of a kinda room by the roots of a tree. We ended up on a plane. Hallbjorn did some cool tracking and we went in a direction. While walking in the forest we came across a giant tree. I blessed it and it turned out it was an illusion (haha I knew that). The spell was of at least 3rd level magic.  After that we came across an abandoned campsite finding a warm fireplace that had been put out ( I think) and chicken wing the cat. Hallbjorn tried to hit the cat so he got scratched big time (9hp). After that black bill cursed hallbjorn and combat got started. 

We defeated black bill eventually with the help of Mazati, Alin and Delilah who came to our aid ust in time! Delilah found us. 3 of us got majoy wounded: hallbjorn, abraxis and masq. We found some like heart thingy, abraxis: 2gp (out of character knowledge), Calumn: a druidic focus that was given to alin. Tomorrow we leave this place on the date on 12th of Moreal. We’re making a few small stops but we’re gonna go to a city. Up north Gräffendam, they have a dam there. The people there are rich and kinda crazy. We ended the session all going to bed. But.. Abraxis had to roll some kinda save? And failed? We don’t know what's up yet. 

Masq came to Calumns hut to talk about their warlock powers. Masq explained that they don’t know where their powers come from and what they think. Calumn and masq decided to talk to mazati about it cuz he had similar stuff. Allin and Constantine took Puppi hunting for a squirrel, while going Puppi asked Calumn if he could come carry him so of course Calumn came. Puppi killed the squirrel and while he was demolishing the squirrel the party found a golem made out of sapwood. Eventually the party figured out the golem came from a very powerful (probably dead cuz old) wizard. Calumn’s touch made the golem awaken. They took the golem home.  
//VOTE FOR BARTH CUZ OF HIS CLOWN OUTFIT FROM HALLOWEEN 

We returned to camp and Calumn tried to convince mazati to take unknown with, then different people did different things. Hallbjorn went out in the forest hunting and he got a deer? And faught a wolf over the deer. He managed to capture a wolf. Abraxis was awoken but he seemed to be out of it with the failed wisdom save. Masq Constantine and alin went to town. Alin made themselves a cow, masq took the form of a morozian gentleman and Constantine was an old man. As Masq had promised Constantine a drink Masq  gave him some money but the tavern was closed. So Constantine broke in and paid 2 silver for a 10gp bottle of wine and stole a piece of pie. Jom jr and the baker's daughter saw it?. Then it moved over masq, saw a horde in town and the torta leader and the head druid is standing and talking to the crowd, they were disturbing the rules of keeping the undead and nature on an equilibrium and basically after she plead her case that she should remain and try to keep things under wraps the crowd kind of decided she was allowed to remain while her powers diminished and the druids keep a check on her so diminished power but it could be worse. Maq looked at the baker's house and woodcutter's house but they was no one there. Then masq looked for a cart so we could take unknown with us but he wasn't there so Alin and masq walked outside and convinced him to come back and see what he could sell us. Sadly we don’t have enough money for the wagon tho we returned. Masq then couldn’t find me or a baker.. Walked on till he could find jom jr in the window and knocked. Spoke to the baker the woodworkers wife isn’t awake yet but at least jom is okay. Masq told her to be careful for the future had to roll that it wasn’t intimidating xD but luckily enough it wasn’t and he rolled well. Alin, constantine and masq are back now and everyones preparing to move on. Masq asked for constantine in the tavern but it turned out he wasn’t there which he was sus about. 

We got ready to leave for Gräffendam today. We concluded that unknown couldn’t come with us on the wagon but he’ll walk, we’ll gave him the cords. Mazati looks more tired than usual and alin saw that mazati had a lot of scars under an illusion (just told him that if he ever wanted to talk he was there). Abraxis made a very cute flower bracelet for his gf and hallbjorn did *something* to feed the wolf :DC30Patethic: then we set out to travel. After a wisdom safe everyone got an uncomfy feeling, on the edge even though we seem alone. Alin witch sighted and felt a slight pull in the direction of the woods. We set out to travel, we found traces of something humongous that has broken down trees and trampled bushes. The pit in our stomach suddenly releases, as the tension inside of us suddenly breaks. The feeling that had been creeping up on us disappears. Mazatis ears perk up and he looks out towards the east. Everyone hears a deep howl with several of us petrified with fear.
Thunderous footsteps barrel though the woods towards us.The beast roars freezing people in their tracks with fear
For the people who failed the save: Every muscle within you freezes up and you find yourself unable to move, to will yourself to even pull the rains and get your carts back into gear eventhough you hear this strange achoing sound of mazati telling everyone to get the fuck into gear.

We started the chase. The frumious bandersnatch was chasing us. We switched around the carts a bunch. And eventually we had to take a sharp right with the carts to avoid a casm. PAPA MAZATI FELL. A lot of people left to the right and went away but Masq, Hallbjorn, Tarvic and Calumn stayed to help (Calumn saved the kids) uncle: trip?  Save him from the bandersnatch. Hallbjorn did a wonderful killing blow to the creature. We left the session not knowing what happened to mazati, but one thing was certain: we are in bad condition and have to get there on our own. 

Uncle .. went down in the casm and grabbed Mazati luckily. We retrieved Mazati and sent him to heal with the troop. We went to retrieve the other group after. The other group discovered a big Secoya tree with some dark altar with bones and shit. Met Claus talked with him. After a little chat (also Claus had a chat with Delilah) he went away and we went back home. But not before alin took some seed (UwU jk Secoya tree)

We did some downtime! :) Calumn, delilah and Abraxas did sylvan school, masq did some work and made (poor) mazati teach thieves tools to him, mazati tried to recover but still is feeling weak, alin did some sweet help moments with the troupe, hallbjorn attempted wolf friend then consequently killed that wolf. While we were travelling we happened upon an old woman(hag) and her stubborn cow who didn’t want to move. While talking we got attacked by wolves, they were defeated (most non lethal I worry for their fate with hallbjorn). After that we met the doomsday gazetteers writer and Alin got a cool cow pot. A little while later winter officially began, while we were chilling around the fire the doomsday gazetteers writer came to ask us about Nov Ostoya. 

///the two parties met up but I was sick that session (barth gave a kinda recap)

Everyone met up at camp (this time everyone everyone except delphine and the baron who were in carts). The stargazers let us know their nov ostoya troubles. I sent Puppi away, Zarius send his familiar after Puppi (I guess to see what Puppi gets up to) and Alins bird went away as well keeping an eye on them. Mazati told us more about the secret message. And Abraxas bought some honey mead from Zarius (1sp). Calumn offered Zarius a room but Zarius declined and in the process (saying Calumn should have a human name cuz he acts like a human) he did the opposite of endearing himself to Calumn. 
After that we went to underdale to learn more about the quest. We found a human raccoon larcein lupain. 

We ended up with larcein lupain . He lives alone and he wants a colourful crystal ball called a cromanova. We learned the cromanova is a magical artefact deeply entwined with graffendam (has to do with a bubble in the city) apparently created by doctor stein, an infamous wizard from the Burach. larcein explained that he wants to get it as revenge and so his people can move on (you see they are like used as slaves in graffendam). There's a huge tower in the inner district, you can find the cromanova at the very top, probably also Houdinky (the previous thief). You cant teleport or fly into it. Magic doesn’t work into there. No levitation flying teleportation works there. Our loot is: 100 pieces a pop and whatever's in there. On top of this he’s a crafter of sorts there isn’t much time I kinda need this thing within the next 5 days. He made a little clockwork wyvern. The tower is connected to a manor and there are tours every day, they might know a thing or two about the chromanova. People come in there all the time to rest. Trying to get a taste of the rich life. 
We decided to go to a pet shop and catch tomorrow's tour of the tower. 
We met a cutie morebounder and Masq is determined to save him because they see themselves in the morebounder who is bullied in the pack and a little small and loopy. After negotiating a bit with the owner we decided to maybe come back for him when we have money. Hallbjorn also bought some stuff for his wolves (treats and I think armour?) Vittorio I think bought armour for pierre. 

Got stopped by a dragon on our way to terrabella, it was kinda weird that he stooped so low to mug us. We meet terrabella in a weirwood tree. There are some apprentacis that she’s training. We realised that the dragon was an illusion from one of her apprentices. We talk about the windsuit, arguing about payment. Pass without a trace go to the island fly. We see a cutie. We stood still cuz they only detect you if you move. They went away after floating on the water. Then we went back to the squirrel. We saw a cavern with silver and gold there. Our general goal is still to get the squirrel and climb the tree to get away. 

We started off session at the foot of the big boi tree, before we made our way further rattigan looked at the gold and silver glitters in the tree and saw a phallic pink object like a glowing wand. We made our way to our squirrel friend, sasquatch they seemed tense and wanted to go quickly but first masq got some more reeths while masq was getting those Puppi got the pink object from the glitter (and discovered a big gold and silver heavy chest). After that we got up on the tree silently and moved forward. Eventually after toaks tried to get a weirwood branch Calumn spotted a sort of weird 10ft high barricade. It turned out to be an adult griffon who was ready to mess us up. Luckily we got away with some quick thinking, mainly Masq’s phantasmal force (also Alins bear spirit and Calumn making alin invisible) we all flew away and got away safely luckily. After delivering the reeths and sasquatch to terrabella we got some enchanted reeths that make us breath underwater (up to 2 hours reusable 1d20 1 it’s gone) and a reeth net that can be thrown away further. We took some time to see what the pink thing was that Puppi got and it turned out to be a magic lipstick that holds 10 uses, if the wearer kisses another it leaves a visible smear and a dc14 saving thrown or charmed by us for an hour. On the lips it fails automatically and lasts 8 hours. While tokas was figuring out what the lipstick was abraxis asked terrabella how he could apologise the best way, she said a Lily of the valley. 
We left terrabella and made our way to the city where Calumn tried to see if we could walk in the water (we asked a guard if it was okay and masq went all karen on him kek) sadly the lake was very cold and awful definitely not something we could just withstand to make our way out of the city without a solution for the cold. After Calumn had some time warming up we ended up making our way to l’arcain with the intent of taking the house tour afterwards. 

We got some of the TECH stuff from our buddy l’arcain. We got to the purple bookworm trying to find out more about Dr Normanstein. 
Alin: distracted the shopkeep and learned more about disembodied.
Masq: found  The Great Malzdreziret the Scaled Imposter, found out more about war and dragons around graffendam (how they eventually defeated the dragon). 
Abraxas: found the book of the seven sisters. A tale about an elf here stuck in a tower until they set her hair on fire. Very sad. But woke up in the arms of an antlered visage and elven face. Forever being in his debt. 
Tokas: found out about: aurelius respite where a rope of divine grace was gifted. And about bonsai trees that are alive/moving in the noble houses. 
Calumn: found a RAD book about golomancy and managed to talk the shopkeep into getting a quest for the book in a few days. 
After that we went to the boot where we met a certain barkeep and masq had a drinking contest with the tourguide we found out: that there’s a secret tunnel to the manor but it leads to the well which is closed unless the speaker opens it, they now use water from the white water temple. The wizard who owned this made owlboars/was a vegan and loved animals, and that he was scared of werewolves calling lycanthropy a curse bad for the soul. After that drinking warwick will likely take over. 
We left off the session with masq being dead drunk, alin and tokas helping him and Abraxas talking to a guard. While Calumn kept his ears open via Puppi in the bar listening in on higher ups. 

Next to the minaret of the speaker is the Walhelm nobel school. We saw the minaret of the speaker. The tour guide was the minotaur dude. We saw the lobby, learned more about dr stein, saw the microscope room and mitosis. We saw owlby’s and other creatures that are living a happy life. In addition to some free baby bois. We learned Dr stein died of old age, was a vegan and was scared of lycanthropy (we already knew that from the bar).  The speaker doesn’t wish for anyone to set foot in the tower so he keeps it locked. After that we went to the white water temple, masq did a big boi lock pick check, we discovered the water elemental in the pump room that they’re using currently, found a Houdinki message and got the key for that room. After that we felt ready for the heist. Delilah also left Abraxis and left his lucky charm. 

Maq pretended to be a young woman and almost made a mechanic fake cheat on his wife. Meanwhile abraxis and alin kept waiting. Calumn and tokas went in and broke free the water genasi with some noise and leaving lots of water behind. Afterwards we went and searched for the pipe luckily (and through Ambers grace) we found it. After swimming through the water we eventually made our way out of the well. The guard went in the room twice and said he’d strengthen the guard even. In the first room (floor 5) we did a pointing puzzle (with help of houdini), we made our way up the stairs but fell down in some gunk (we got 2 bottles of it). After that we found dr nomensteins room (floor 8) with knowledge of nomenstin and help from Houdninki we made our way through the room (we met his helping hand, an automaton and a invisible servant) and looted some stuff (like plushies, a wizard book and a nighttime story). After that we went up the stairs to the next room. Sadly it turned out to be a mimic. We made our way out with some pepper. After that we found ourselves in an identical room to the first one we found ourselves in but a difference of colour and feeling in the air. The room hums with stored potency. A mistake might be fatal. A sign to our right reads floor one. That’s where we left off last session. 

Last session we started off in another pointy arrow room, this time we had a different path. On that path we came across 2 doors. Tokas found a coin mimic in the first room and Calumn found a exoskeleton in the other room. After we made our way across that room we climbed up a floor and found the room with the chromanova in it. There was a ladder that reached up to darkness in the room and on that darkness walked a hoved beast. Magic was buzzing in this room.  After some investigating and finding a hint from Houdinki. We all made a quick plan, trying to grab stuff from the room and get away from Abraxis; horn, Alin: rings, Calumn: wand, Tokas: chromanova. Masq opened the door and we all attempted to grab our stuff except when alin grabbed one of the rings the octopus he grabbed it from came to life. When tokas grabbed the chromanova the hooved monster fell on us. Calumn almost got downed but luckily got healed up and abraxis did get downed but with a nice safe from Alin got out as well. We all made it up on the tower where Houdinki was. We put on our suits and flied away with him avoiding the crossbow bolts because of the weather. We went safely to the shore in a boat to go to unterdam and made our way over to L’arcain. We got our money and were taken away by the urkin to see beautiful fireworks that L’arcain made out of the chormenova for makers week. Enjoying the victory the urkin had on this town. (everyone got an inspiration) 

We started off the session on the 24th of Nachhexen this date brining winter to a close. Back at camp with our troup, our family in our midst. Except one, an empty space springs out in stark contrast to the companionship from our troupe. Delilah is still missing. Mazati said she went off in the direction of the town and so we went there. We made our way past the starbright jewellery where tokas got a quest from a “half dragon” (half dragon half human) . They know their mom but not their dad and wanted to have more info about their dad in return for delphines blackstone arm being non radioactive. After that some shopping and merchandising happened (alin got a quilt for 16gp and tokas got a shady deal). From there we went to the purple bookstore to get a FUCKING RAD QUEST we’re gonna be PIRATES AAAHH!!! We said we’d discuss it with everyone and then decide to go. After this we inquired about Delilah once more and found out from a woman that she’s in the colossal boots. There we spotted Delilah being romanced by Jackie deytona himself. He was playing hey there delilah. Abraxas talked with delilah coming to understand that she doesn’t want to be romantically involved (I think at least) but Abraxas kept his mood up and said he will be with her still even if she doesn’t feel things quite the same way he does. With everyone safe and sound at home of course we went off again to the enclave, we arrived on the 25th of Nachhexen. We met the other group in the lucky lute and caught up with hallbjorn adventures. 

We started off session on the 25th? I believe of Nachhexen, we stayed in at the Ravens claw with Alin. During an idyllic morning Alin happened upon a snake necklace. This prompted a flashback to yesterday night. Where we met a few people and gathered a quest. Notably we met stephan a fire genasi assassin who wished upon a star to be forgotten. He lost his sister to a monster in an unfortunate twist of fate and is here to seek revenge on that monster. All except alin have forgotten him. Today we plan on talking to Alin about stephan and prepping/going to our quest! 

We left off last session having all forgotten about stephan but one, alin. This session we’ve discussed (in text rp) a bit more about stephan resolving to help him as best we can if we remember him. However we have a quest to do so we went to the tavern to meet up with the blind dragonborn Iar, his familiar Ekhat (a stone thingy) noticed something bad in the tunnels, like a bad feeling so they haven’t felt good going anymore. Iar wants us to go find out what has been watching them in the cave. With some directions from Iar (so directions from a blind person's perspective) we set off to find our way. We sadly don’t make it immediately however so we have to stay the night in the cave. Masq and Alin both have dreams, Masq’s dreamt about seeing a creature with tentacles and 3 eyes through a crack in a maze of mirrors. Alin dreamt that they saw different stars up in the sky, walked to a place with 4 pillars after which the pillars melt and a sticky material melts onto the POV. From this dream alin turns into a small spider. When the day starts again we move further into the cave, happening on a place with glowing green mushrooms, as well as some yellow glowing light at the centre of this room. It turns out that this was the Uninvited, a monster that we now face. The uninvited left off 3 eye rays. That’s where we ended the session. 

We ended off last session with the uninvited pointing 3 eye rays at us. We fought the uninvited, while we fought we found some of his lil minions, they rather used mental effects like charmed/feared and stuff to attack us rather than actual damage. As we mostly stayed in the hall we had trouble avoiding their eye rays. While fighting Masq went to the side and did a one on one with one of the minions defeating it before the end to turn onto the boss. Hallbjorn had a notable moment in the fight as well, attacking the uninvited but gaining a scar on his hand because he got downed, the mark of the uninvited is on him now. While we were fighting the uninvited spoke to Calumn saying that Calumn was not like the others and “we must acquire this one”. The uninvited tried to grapple Calumn. When Calumn fought away and the uninvited was busy fighting the rest this did open up a place for Calumn to throw sand in the uninvited eyes. During the fight the uninvited also told Masq that “this is a grave mistake” and “this mountain will be your tomb” which is unsettling indeed. In the end Hallbjorn got his revenge for being downed, landing the killing blow on the uninvited. We’re left off with the enemies being defeated, but some questions remain for the dreamlanders still.. 

We had more luck travelling back. We did some downtime,  Masq & Calumn worked in the library and did research and learned tinkers tools respectively. Alin grew some plants and left them out for free, he got some stuff back. Abraxas did work with Jayce Goldsmile (made her a sign) and did some carousing. He got a jewellery box for his troubles with the image of the order of the white sun on there that we learn leads him to a lake. Calumn got a *very* old mask that has “Follow the god below, sait it’s hunger”  on it. We learn that the same stuff is written on the spires all around. To learn about these items we talked to Tokas, Vittorio, Jayce Goldsmile and finally Aayani of Veyv. In addition to that we learned about Korvilla apparently living in marrow hall, Aayani said to not go too close as it’s connected to the deep reach somewhere where no adventurers have gone before. It’s now up to us to pick a quest. Will we go see Korvillas handkerchief? Follow the jewellery box? Or the mask? 



After being attacked we moved on further down the cavern. But sadly there were monsters there as well. With nice calm emotions and some struggling from alin and masq we almost got away, sadly this wasn’t in the stars. Just as we were running away Hallbjorn got attacked, he attacked the enemies back ending the calm emotions spell. We fought a good fight but all eventually perished. When we saw this: 
In front of you is an imposing, twisting iron-wrought archway. Atop it, illuminated letters glow red, reflecting off the thick forest 
fog, making the letters difficult to read. Night has fallen like a thick blanket, and a full moon grins down from the sky—a little too close for comfort.
Before you is a wondrous, vibrant carnival. Sweethearts stroll hand in hand, munching on delectable treats. Creatures and persons of all kinds walk around with smiles on their faces. Laughter rings in the air. Strangely dressed clowns with brightly coloured hair 
and outfits roam through the crowds. Everywhere there are many tents and buildings, most emblazoned with colourful signage. 
In the distance, at the centre of the carnival, is a large colourful sign board. Behind it, a huge red tent looms, its spires piercing the 
misty veil overhead. You also catch a glimpse of a glittering Farris wheel. Both the tent and the wheel appear hazy, like a mirage.
Half hidden behind a nearby tent, sitting on the ground with an arm around their waist as they beckon you, is a humanoid figure.

We started out session with the newest member of our group Lizander arriving in the Revelia. Lizander is injured sadly but still managed to carry a child to the circus. However a kind lady called Marlowe called him into the shadows and explained that everything isn’t as it seems at the revelia. That Heckna can hear anything. And people aren’t to be trusted. Marlowe also explained that she’s here to find Matteo. She told us to go to the ticket booth where we’d get newcomers tickets. After that she had to go quickly because Heckna’s parade came by. During the parade we met Pinky & Maphew who explained some more. Maphew ended up wanting to come with us. We decided to make our way to get the tickets with Maphew as our guide. During the walk we saw the heck-yeah-tron some kinda tv in the sky. On there we saw ourselves being introduced. We got our 10 tickets from polly and tried to do a game to make more tickets. On our way to pin the donkey a child tried to steal Calumns mask which made us protect our stuff better. We ended the session with pin the donkey, with the donkey breaking out of the confines and to us the task. 


We ended up beating the donkey back which you know is great for us and very poor for the evil “donkey”. After that we got 3 tickets back! After our fight we found ourselves very tired. So we made our way to the hostile hostel. In there we met a marionette named Ramona Ramblerumper who requested we help with a noise complaint in exchange for 2 nights at the inn and half off the other nights. We got a box full of “keys” in the form of different things like tickets, a rattler and an actual key. We also got the info that she doesn’t know where she left room 9 and that there are 2 people signed into the guest book. We went and looked at the doors then went into the first room where we found (UwU) Our host Laird Bubble of Squeak Alin was the star of the show! Luckily Alin went through the interview successfully and thus got a big fat cheque of 1 red ticket! After that we slept in the room. (side note Laird bubble of squeak asked us if we saw scooter cuz he said he went to a different room) 

After some “rest” if you can call standing in a room full of screams that, we went on to the space room! Where Alin sadly ate some popcorn that wasn’t popcorn so we had to fight a swarm and Alin got very sick instead of clownafied they rather got candyfied. Before that got really serious however we went onto the jungleroom which was fine and dandy except for the giant fucking monster in there which Calumn noticed and luckily everybody listened to him to get out. After that we sadly couldn’t get into the water room we’ll have to try again later. But we did get into the boring room! And got promptly attacked by snozlings which we fought off luckily making a very amusing fight between a snozling and spider Alin on Calumns face. After that we cut down a tree and went into the camping room, we’ll see what comes next in this room.
